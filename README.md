Hi this is the Full Stack Project using MERN Stack.

#Introduction to the HR Management Project
Overview
This system is designed to streamline and enhance HR operations within our organization. Our HR Management system is divided into two primary domains: the Employee Domain and the Admin Domain.

Employee Domain
The Employee Domain is tailored to meet the needs of our employees, providing them with essential tools and functionalities to manage their work-related activities efficiently. Hereâ€™s what employees can do in this domain:
View Salary Details: Employees can easily access and review their salary information.
Project Details: Employees can view details about the projects they are assigned to.
Report Project Details: Employees have the capability to report their project progress and details directly to their manager.
Apply for Leave: The system allows employees to apply for leave with a streamlined process.
Leave History: All leave applications and their statuses are stored and reflected in a detailed table, allowing employees to keep track of their leave history.

Admin Domain (Manager)
The Admin Domain is designed for managers, providing them with a robust set of tools to manage their team effectively. Managers have the following capabilities:
Add Employees: Managers can add new employees to the system.
Assign Projects: Managers can assign projects to employees based on their roles and skills.
Manage Salaries: Managers can add and update salary details for employees.
Approve or Decline Leave Requests: Managers can review and make decisions on leave applications submitted by employees.
Edit Project Details: Managers have the authority to edit project details as needed.
View All Employees and Projects: Managers can view a comprehensive list of all employees and all projects within the organization.
